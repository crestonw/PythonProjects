    "##### Speeding on the I-5, Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 3.12 states that the distribution of speeds of cars traveling on the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) in California is nearly normal with a mean of 72.6 miles/hour and a standard deviation of 4.78 miles/hour. The speed limit on this stretch of the I-5 is 70 miles/hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) A highway patrol officer is hidden on the side of the freeway. What is the probability that 5 cars pass and none are speeding? Assume that the speeds of the cars are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    ".7054 is the probability that a car is driving over 70 mile/hour. So then the probability that none of the five cars pass are speeding is represented by:  (1 - .7054)^5 = .0022  or .22% probability that five cars in a row aren't speeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (b) On average, how many cars would the highway patrol officer expect to watch until the first car that is speeding? What is the standard deviation of the number of cars he would expect to watch?\n",
    "    \n",
    "We are looking for a mean of a Geometric Distribution. So the average number of cars expected to be seen before one is speeding is 1.4 cars."

    "The 2009 holiday retail season, which kicked off on November 27, 2009 (the day after Thanksgiving), had been marked by somewhat lower self-reported consumer spending than was seen during the comparable period in 2008. To get an estimate of consumer spending, 436 randomly sampled American adults were surveyed. Daily consumer spending for the six-day period after Thanksgiving, spanning the Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday, averaged 84.71. A 95% confidence interval based on this sample is (80.31, 89.11). Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (a) We are 95% confident that the average spending of these 436 American adults is between 80.31 and 89.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "True, this is the information that the 95% confidence interval provides.\n",

    "    (c) 95% of random samples have a sample mean between 80.31 and 89.11.\n",

    "True, this is why we take the confidence interval is to determine how likely we are to capture the population mean when taking a random sample.\n",

    "    (e) A 90% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95% confidence interval since we don’t need to be as sure about our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "False, it would be wider because we would be less accurate as to where the true mean is located.\n",

    "    (f) In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95% confidence interval to a third of what it is now, we would need to use a sample 3 times larger.\n",
