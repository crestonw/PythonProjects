# Python_Projects
Multiple projects from different college courses at the University of Oregon all implemented with Python.

## CIS_211_Projects
This folder contains multiple projects that were completed in Python during my studies at the University of Oregon (UO). CIS 211 is second course in a three course series that introduces students into the topic of Computer Science via programming languages.

## CIS_399_Projects
This folder contains three projects that were completed in Python during my studies at the UO. This particular CIS 399 course was a probability and statistics course focused towards Computer and Information Science students. So, these projects implement some of pythons packages that are used to understand and manipulate data.
